# Geez-Number-Prediction
## Installation
**Importing Libraries**</br>
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* CV2

### Instructions:
In this project will built and training Geez number prediction model. We will use a dataset consisting of Geez/ Amharic digits (1-9). We will  develop a deep, fully-connected ("feed-forward") neural network model that can classify these images. In the process we will discuss:<br>

* Data collection and preparation
* Implementing Deep feed forward Neural networks
  - Libraries
  - Reading Data with data generators
      - Data augmentation
* Transfer Learning
